# Field View
It provides a dynamic and interactive visualization of the game field, allowing teams to monitor their robot's position, orientation, and interactions with game elements in real-time. This feature is particularly useful for debugging autonomous flows, tracking robot movements.

It works live a canvas, so it can be used for any drawing application.

## Supported Objects
1. Line
2. Circle
3. Rectangle

More will be added soon

## Customization
You can change the orientation and show a coordinates grid inside the `settings menu`.
There are also methods on the `Canvas` object to change the orientation programatically: `setOffsets`.

## Gotchas
1. Objects are drawn in the order they are sent to the `debug` function, and their layering (z-index) is automatically managed by the system.
2. The input order is flexible, you can provide Drawable objects and text lines in any order within the debug function.
3. Every Drawable object requires a `look` to define its visual appearance. The look specifies styling attributes such as fillColor, outlineColor, outlineWidth.

## Offsets

You can offset the canvas coordinate system using either custom parameters or predefined presets. This action can be performed on both the `Canvas` and the `Telemetry` instance exposed by Panels.

### Included Presets

* `PANELS`: Default
* `ROADRUNNER`
* `PEDRO_PATHING`

You can also define custom presets by implementing the `CanvasPreset` interface.

### Example

```kotlin
val PEDRO_PATHING = CanvasPreset {
    it.offsetX = -24.0 * 3
    it.offsetY =  24.0 * 3
    it.rotation = CanvasRotation.DEG_270
}
```

## Example OpMode File: `TestOpMode.kt`
Below is an example of how field telemetry can be implemented in an OpMode:

## Example Drawer File: `Drawer.kt`
Below is an example of how field telemetry can be implemented in an utility without the opMode loop:
